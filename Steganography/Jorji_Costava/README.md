In the light of recent terrorist attacks, Arstotzka has closed off it's borders. Jorji needs to get into Arstotzka as he has very important business to tend to. Luckily Jorji has a friend at the border patrol who has managed to get Jorji a pre-approved passport number. Jorji has received an email with a .pdf file from his friend which contains the password. Jorji is no good with computers. Can you help Jorji find the passport number he needs to get his passport made?
